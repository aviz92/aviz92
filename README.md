# Hi, I'm Avi 👋

🎓 **B.Sc. Electrical Engineering | M.Sc. System Engineering** <br>
🚀 **Automation Infrastructure Architect | Technical Leader | Python Expert**

Innovative and results-driven **Automation Infrastructure Architect** with a strong background in designing and developing scalable automation solutions. Passionate about driving efficiency, reliability, and performance through modern automation frameworks, cloud technologies, and DevOps methodologies.

With a proven track record of leading infrastructure transitions from in-house to industrial solutions, I focus on creating robust, modular architectures that ensure flexibility and long-term growth. My expertise spans Python development, CI/CD processes, cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker), and automation frameworks.

Beyond technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with DevOps, R&D, and QA teams to optimize workflows and enhance product quality.
